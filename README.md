# Accident-Alerting-System
Accident Alert Location Tracking System
A signal from an accelerometer and a GPS sensor are routinely despatched to the cloud and from there, an alert message will be received by whoever is subscribed to that car. The signal indicates the severity of the coincidence and the GPS place. The ambulance use the GPS location to get to the accident place.
